Make sure all files you want converted to PDF are in the folder with the scipts. 
Run the Converter script to convert and merge all the files to PDF.
The merged file will be called merged.pdf.

Current supported file types are .jpg .PNG and .jpeg

.docx and .txt files will soon be suppported.

The delete script will deleted all pdf files but the merged one.

A pycache folder will be created in the folder with the scipts. Leave this folder as it helps the program run faster.

If the script is not working for you it most likely is because you don't have python 3 installed or you are missing libraries needed for the program to run.
